## Gillespieâ€™s algorithm for stochastic reactions.
# Code derived from 
# http://www.lamfa.u-picardie.fr/asch/f/t/anglais/ressources/chem_reac.pdf

# Stoichiometric matrix
# Each column is a reaction (will be parsed from file)
# A + B --c1--> C
# C --c2--> A + B
# C --c3--> B + D

V = [[-1; -1; 1; 0] [1; 1; -1; 0] [0; 1; -1; 1]];

### Parameters and Initial Conditions
X    = zeros(4,1);
X(1) = 20; # quantity of A
X(2) = 10; # quantity of B

c(1) = 1e-2; c(2) = 1e-4; c(3) = 1e-1; # rates

t      = 0;
tfinal = 50;
Y = X;
T = t;

### Simulation 
while t < tfinal
  # Update propensities
  a(1) = c(1)*X(1)*X(2);
  a(2) = c(2)*X(3);
  a(3) = c(3)*X(3);

  # Update time
  asum = sum (a);
  tau  = log (1/rand) / asum;
  
  # Find th eindex of the reaction that will occur
  j = min (find (rand < cumsum(a/asum)));

  # Update quantities
  X = X + V(:,j);
  t = t + tau;
  
  # Record
  Y(:,end+1) = X;
  T(end+1)   = t;
end

plot (T, Y.');
